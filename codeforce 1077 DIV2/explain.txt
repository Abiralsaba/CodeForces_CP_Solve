Codeforces Round 1077 (Div. 2) - Problem Explanations
======================================================

Problem A: Maximize the Difference
----------------------------------
What's the problem?
You're given a number n, and you need to arrange numbers from 1 to n to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

How I solved it:
Alternate between smallest and largest remaining numbers, starting from the end. Placing small and large numbers next to each other creates maximum differences.

Example: For n=5, we get [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] instead of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Problem B: Binary String Lights
-------------------------------
What's the problem?
You have a binary string (0s and 1s). Find minimum number of "lit" positions needed. 1s are already lit, and each light can cover 3 positions.

How I solved it:
1. Count all existing 1s (already lit)
2. For each segment of continuous 0s, check if bounded by 1s
3. Remaining 0s need extra lights: (remaining + 2) / 3


Problem C: Minimize the Difference
----------------------------------
What's the problem?
Given an array, find one element to change so array becomes sorted. Find minimum "cost" where cost = max distance from original value to min or max of array.

How I solved it:
1. Sort a copy of the array
2. Find elements that are "out of place" (bad elements)
3. If already sorted, output -1
4. For each bad element: cost = max(element - min, max - element)
5. Return smallest cost


Problem D: Bitwise AND Equals Zero
----------------------------------
What's the problem?
Given x and y, find p and q where p AND q = 0, minimizing |x - p| + |y - q|.

How I solved it:
Bit manipulation - for AND to be 0, at each bit position, at least one of p or q must have 0.
Try different strategies for each bit (0 to 31):
- Set that bit in p, clear it in q
- Set that bit in q, clear it in p
- Round to powers of 2, use masks
Track minimum cost across all combinations.
